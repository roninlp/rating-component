## My process

### Built with

- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) Build tool

### What I learned

I used this frontend mentor challenge to improve my knowledge over Tailwind CSS and how I can use it on simple components. I also learned how to use custom fonts with Tailwind . I used Vite as the build tool for the first time now and it was a great experience.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind Labs YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOnBG2wUm1s) - This helped with setting up the font family for this project.
